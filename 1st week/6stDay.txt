Day 6: AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) Basics

1. IAM Concepts
IAM Users
An IAM user represents a person or application that interacts with AWS.
Each user has unique credentials (username/password or access keys) to access AWS services.
Users can be granted specific permissions to perform actions on AWS resources.

IAM Groups
A group is a collection of IAM users.
Instead of assigning permissions to individual users, you can assign permissions to a group, and all users in the group inherit those permissions.
Simplifies permission management for multiple users with similar access needs.

IAM Roles
A role is an IAM entity that defines a set of permissions but is not associated with a specific user or group.
Roles are assumed by users, applications, or AWS services to gain temporary permissions.
Commonly used for cross-account access or granting AWS services (e.g., EC2, Lambda) permissions to interact with other services.

IAM Policies
Policies are JSON documents that define permissions.
They specify what actions are allowed or denied on which AWS resources.
Policies can be attached to users, groups, or roles.

Principle of Least Privilege
Grant only the minimum permissions necessary for a user, group, or role to perform their tasks.
Reduces the risk of accidental or malicious misuse of AWS resources.

2. Hands-on:
Create an IAM user with limited permissions.
Explore different IAM policies.
