Day 4: Networking Basics on Linux

Network Configuration:

Understand static and dynamic IP address configuration.
Explore the /etc/netplan directory for network configuration files (on Ubuntu).
Modify a network configuration file (e.g., sudo nano /etc/netplan/01-network-manager-all.yaml) to set a static IP address. Apply the changes with sudo netplan apply.
Network Tools:

ping: Test network connectivity (e.g., ping google.com)
traceroute: Trace the route to a host (e.g., traceroute google.com)
ip a: Display network interface information
ss: Display socket statistics (a modern replacement for netstat)
Hands-on:

Configure a static IP address for your VM.
Use ping and traceroute to test network connectivity to different hosts.
Use ip a to view your network interface configuration.
Proof: Take screenshots of the terminal output for each command.
