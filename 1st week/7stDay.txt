Day 7: Review and Practice

Review: Go over all the topics and commands covered during the week.
Practice: Continue practicing Linux commands and AWS console navigation.
Troubleshooting: Try to intentionally misconfigure something (e.g., network settings) and then use the learned commands and tools to troubleshoot and fix the issue.
Mini-Project: Set up a simple website on your Linux VM using the nginx web server. Create a basic HTML page and configure nginx to serve it. This will give you a hands-on experience with web server configuration and Linux administration.
Proof: Take a screenshot of your website running on your Linux VM, accessed from your host machine's web browser.
