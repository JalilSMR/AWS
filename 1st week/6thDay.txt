Day 6: AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) Basics

IAM Concepts:

Understand IAM users, groups, roles, and policies.
Learn the principle of least privilege (granting only necessary permissions).
Hands-on:

Create an IAM user with a specific name (e.g., "MyIAMUser").
Assign the user to a group (e.g., "ReadOnlyAccess").
Attach a policy to the group that grants read-only access to S3.
Proof: Take screenshots of the IAM user, group, and policy configuration in the AWS Management Console.
