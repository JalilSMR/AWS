This document outlines the tasks for the first week of your AWS Certified Solutions Architect Professional preparation, focusing on Operating Systems (Linux) and initial AWS exploration.

Overall Goal: Establish a solid Linux foundation and begin familiarizing yourself with the AWS environment.

Daily/Ongoing Tasks:

 Active Recall: After studying a topic, try to recall the key concepts without looking at your notes. This strengthens memory and understanding.
 Spaced Repetition: Review previously learned material at increasing intervals to reinforce long-term retention. Use flashcards or a spaced repetition software (e.g., Anki).
 AWS Free Tier Exploration:  Dedicate time each day to explore the AWS Free Tier.  Even simple actions in the console reinforce learning.

Week 1 To-Do List:

Day 1: Setting up Your Linux Environment

1. Choose a Distribution: Select a Linux distribution for your virtual machine (VM). Ubuntu or CentOS are recommended for AWS familiarity.
2. Virtual Machine Setup:
     Download and install a virtualization platform (VirtualBox or VMware).
     Download the ISO image of your chosen Linux distribution.
     Create a new VM. Allocate sufficient resources (at least 2 CPUs, 4GB RAM, 20GB disk space).
     Install the Linux distribution on the VM.
3. Basic Linux Commands:
     Practice navigating the file system (cd, ls, pwd).
     Learn file manipulation commands (touch, cp, mv, rm, mkdir, rmdir).
     Explore basic system information commands (uname, hostname, uptime).
4. Resources:
     LinuxCommand.org: Excellent resource for learning Linux commands.
     OverTheWire Wargames: Fun way to learn Linux security concepts.

Day 2: Linux User and Permission Management

1. User Management:
     Learn to create, modify, and delete users (useradd, usermod, userdel).
     Understand user groups (groupadd, groupmod, groupdel).
     Practice switching between users (su, sudo).
2. Permissions:
     Understand file permissions (read, write, execute).
     Learn to change file permissions (chmod).
     Explore special permissions (SUID, SGID, sticky bit).
3. Hands-on:
     Create multiple users and groups.
     Assign different permissions to files and directories.
     Practice using sudo for administrative tasks.
4. Resources:
     Linux man pages (e.g., `man chmod`).

Day 3: Package Management and System Updates

1. Package Managers:
     Learn about apt (Debian/Ubuntu) or yum (CentOS/RHEL).
     Practice installing, updating, and removing software packages.
2. System Updates:
     Learn how to update the system and installed packages.
3. Hands-on:
     Install a web server (Apache or Nginx) using the package manager.
     Update the system to the latest packages.
4. Resources:
     Distribution-specific documentation (e.g., Ubuntu Server Guide).

Day 4: Networking Basics on Linux

1. Network Configuration:
     Learn to configure static and dynamic IP addresses.
     Understand network interfaces and how to manage them.
2. Network Tools:
     Practice using `ping`, `traceroute`, `netstat`, `ip`, and `ifconfig`.
3. Hands-on:
     Configure network interfaces on your VM.
     Test network connectivity using network tools.
4. Resources:
     Linux networking tutorials online.

Day 5: Introduction to AWS and the Management Console

1. AWS Account Setup:
     Create an AWS account. Be aware of the AWS Free Tier limitations.
2. AWS Management Console Exploration:
     Familiarize yourself with the AWS Management Console.
     Explore different services and their functionalities.
     Navigate through the console and understand the layout.
3. AWS Regions and Availability Zones:
     Understand the concept of AWS Regions and Availability Zones.
     Identify the closest AWS Region to you.
4. Resources:
     AWS Getting Started Guide.

Day 6: AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) Basics

1. IAM Concepts:
     Learn about IAM users, groups, roles, and policies.
     Understand the principle of least privilege.
2. Hands-on:
     Create an IAM user with limited permissions.
     Explore different IAM policies.
3. Resources:
     AWS IAM Documentation.

Day 7: Review and Practice

1. Review: Review all the topics covered during the week.
2. Practice: Practice Linux commands and AWS console navigation.
3. Troubleshooting: Try to troubleshoot common Linux and AWS issues.
4. Plan for Week 2:  Preview the topics for the next week (Security, Identity Management, Monitoring, and Automation) and start gathering resources.
