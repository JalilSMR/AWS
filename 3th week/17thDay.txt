Day 17:  S3 Security and Access Control

1. Access Control Lists (ACLs):
    * Understand how ACLs work for fine-grained access control to S3 buckets and objects.
        ACLs allow you to grant granular permissions to specific AWS accounts or predefined groups for S3 buckets and objects.
        They provide a way to control access at the bucket and object level.

2. Bucket Policies:
    * Learn to use bucket policies to manage permissions at the bucket level.
        Bucket policies offer a more flexible way to manage permissions at the bucket level using JSON-based policies.
        They allow you to define conditions and actions for controlling access to your S3 buckets.
3. S3 Security Best Practices:
    * Explore security best practices for S3, including encryption, versioning, and logging.
        Encryption: Encrypt your data at rest and in transit using server-side encryption with Amazon S3-managed keys (SSE-S3), AWS KMS-managed keys (SSE-KMS), or customer-provided keys (SSE-C). 
            Encryption protects your data from unauthorized access, even if the storage media is compromised.
        Versioning: Enable versioning to keep multiple versions of your objects, protecting against accidental deletion or overwriting.
            Versioning allows you to recover previous versions of your objects if needed.
        Logging: Enable logging to track access requests to your buckets, providing an audit trail for security analysis.
            Logging helps you identify suspicious activity and troubleshoot access issues.
        MFA Delete: Enable MFA Delete to require multi-factor authentication for deleting buckets, adding an extra layer of protection against accidental or malicious deletion. 
            MFA Delete helps prevent unauthorized deletion of your buckets.
        Public Access Block: Configure public access block to prevent public access to your buckets and objects, ensuring that only authorized users can access your data.
            Public access block helps prevent accidental or intentional exposure of your data.
4. Hands-on:
    * Configure ACLs and bucket policies to control access to your S3 bucket.
    * Enable versioning and logging on your S3 bucket.
    * Experiment with S3 encryption options (SSE-S3, SSE-KMS, SSE-C).
