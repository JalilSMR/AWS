Review
Review all topics covered during the week.
Revisit the basic web server you set up in Week 2 and identify areas for improvement.
Project Enhancement
Apply your knowledge from this week to enhance the security and functionality of your web server.
Consider:
Implementing EBS volumes for storage: Replace the instance store with an EBS volume for persistent storage. This ensures that your data is not lost if the instance is terminated.
Using S3 for website backups: Configure automated backups of your website files to S3. This provides a secure and durable backup solution.
Optimizing your VPC configuration: Use separate subnets for different tiers of your application (e.g., web servers, databases). This enhances security and network performance.
Applying Well-Architected Framework principles: Review your web server architecture against the five pillars and identify areas for improvement.
Proof: Take screenshots of your enhanced web server configuration, EBS volume setup, S3 backup configuration, and any other improvements you make.
Linux Troubleshooting Exercises
Here are some basic troubleshooting exercises that you can perform on your Linux instances:
Check disk usage: Use the df -h command to display disk usage information for mounted partitions. This helps you identify if you're running out of disk space.
Identify hanging processes: Use the ps aux | grep <process_name> command to find processes that might be consuming excessive resources or causing issues. You can then use the kill command to terminate these processes.
Troubleshoot network connectivity: Use the ping command to test connectivity to a remote host. If you're unable to ping a host, use the traceroute command to trace the path that packets take to reach the host and identify any network issues along the way.
