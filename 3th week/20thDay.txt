Day 20: Introduction to the AWS Well-Architected Framework

1. Five Pillars:
    * Learn about the five pillars of the Well-Architected Framework:
        Operational Excellence: This pillar focuses on running and monitoring systems to deliver business value and continually improve supporting processes. 
            It includes best practices for automating operations, monitoring systems, and responding to incidents.
        Security: This pillar emphasizes protecting information and systems. It includes best practices for implementing a strong security strategy, 
            controlling access to resources, and protecting data.
        Reliability: This pillar addresses the ability of a system to recover from disruptions, acquire computing resources to meet demand, and mitigate disruptions. 
            It includes best practices for designing fault-tolerant architectures, implementing disaster recovery plans, and testing systems for resilience.
        Performance Efficiency: This pillar focuses on using computing resources efficiently to meet system requirements and maintaining that efficiency as demand changes.
            It includes best practices for selecting the right instance types, optimizing storage, and monitoring performance.
        Cost Optimization: This pillar emphasizes avoiding unnecessary costs. It includes best practices for choosing the right pricing models, monitoring spending, 
            and optimizing resource utilization.
2. Design Principles:
    * Understand the design principles for each pillar.
3. Hands-on:
