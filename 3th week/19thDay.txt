Day 19:  Advanced VPC Configurations

1. Subnet Types:
    * Understand different subnet types (public, private, NAT gateway).
        Public subnets: These subnets have a route to an internet gateway, allowing instances within them to have public IP addresses and communicate with the internet. 
            Public subnets are typically used for resources that need to be accessible from the internet, such as web servers.
        Private subnets: These subnets do not have a route to an internet gateway, keeping instances isolated from the internet. 
            This is suitable for resources that should not be publicly accessible, such as databases.
        NAT gateway subnets: These subnets host NAT gateways, which allow instances in private subnets to access the internet while remaining protected from unsolicited inbound traffic. 
            NAT gateways provide a way for instances in private subnets to download updates, access external APIs, and communicate with other AWS services without exposing them to the public internet.
    * Learn about the purpose and use cases for each subnet type.
2. Route Tables and Network ACLs:
    * Deepen your understanding of route tables and how they control network traffic flow.
    * Explore network ACLs for stateless packet filtering.
        Route tables: These tables define the rules for directing network traffic within a VPC. Each subnet is associated with a route table, which determines how 
            traffic is routed to different destinations. Route tables allow you to control how traffic flows between subnets, to the internet, and to on-premises networks.
        Network ACLs: These are stateless packet filters that operate at the subnet level. They provide an additional layer of security by allowing you to define rules 
            for allowing or denying traffic based on IP addresses, ports, and protocols. Network ACLs act as a first line of defense for your subnets, blocking unwanted 
            traffic before it reaches your instances.
3. Hands-on:
    * Create a VPC with public and private subnets.
    * Launch EC2 instances in different subnets.
    * Configure route tables and network ACLs to control traffic flow.
