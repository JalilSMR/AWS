Day 18:  S3 Data Management Features

1. Lifecycle Policies:
    * Learn to create lifecycle policies to automate data management tasks (e.g., archiving, deleting old objects).
        Lifecycle policies automate data management tasks in S3. You can create lifecycle rules to transition objects to different storage classes (e.g., Glacier) 
        or delete them after a certain period. This helps you optimize storage costs and manage your data efficiently.
2. S3 Transfer Acceleration:
    * Understand how S3 Transfer Acceleration can improve upload speeds.
        S3 Transfer Acceleration improves upload speeds to S3 by using Amazon CloudFront's edge network. It's like having a global network of accelerators that help 
        your data reach S3 faster. This is especially useful for transferring large files or data from geographically distant locations.
3. Cross-Region Replication:
    * Explore how to configure cross-region replication for disaster recovery.
        Cross-region replication can be used for disaster recovery by replicating data to another AWS region. 
        This ensures that your data is available even if an entire region experiences an outage.
4. Hands-on:
    * Create a lifecycle policy to transition objects to Glacier after a certain period.
    * Enable S3 Transfer Acceleration for your bucket.
    * Configure cross-region replication for your bucket.
