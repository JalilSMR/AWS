    * Learn about different EC2 instance types and their characteristics.
    * Explore Amazon Machine Images (AMIs).
2. Hands-on:
    * Launch an EC2 instance using the AWS Management Console.
    * Connect to the instance using SSH.
    * Explore the instance's operating system and configuration.
3. Resources:
    * AWS EC2 documentation.
    * AWS EC2 FAQs.

Day 11: EC2 Security and Networking

1. Security Groups:
    * Understand how security groups work as virtual firewalls for EC2 instances.
    * Learn to configure security group rules to control inbound and outbound traffic.
2. Elastic IP Addresses:
    * Explore the concept of Elastic IP addresses and their use cases.
3. Hands-on:
    * Create and configure security groups for your EC2 instance.
    * Assign an Elastic IP address to your instance.
4. Resources:
    * AWS Security Groups documentation.

Day 12: Introduction to Amazon S3

1. S3 Concepts:
    * Understand what Amazon S3 is and its use cases.
    * Learn about S3 buckets, objects, and keys.
    * Explore S3 storage classes and their cost implications.
2. Hands-on:
    * Create an S3 bucket.
    * Upload and download files to/from the bucket.
    * Experiment with different S3 storage classes.
3. Resources:
    * Amazon S3 documentation.
    * Amazon S3 FAQs.

Day 13: Amazon VPC Fundamentals

1. VPC Concepts:
    * Understand what Amazon VPC is and its benefits.
    * Learn about subnets, route tables, and internet gateways.
    * Explore network access control lists (NACLs).
2. Hands-on:
    * Create a VPC with a public subnet.
    * Launch an EC2 instance in the public subnet.
    * Configure routing to allow internet access from the instance.
3. Resources:
    * Amazon VPC documentation.
    * Amazon VPC FAQs.

Day 14: Mini Project - Secure Web Server Deployment

Goal: Apply your knowledge to deploy a secure web server on AWS.

1. Environment Setup:
    * Launch an EC2 instance in your VPC.
    * Configure security groups to allow HTTP/HTTPS access.
2. Web Server Installation:
    * Install a web server (Apache or Nginx) on the instance.
    * Configure the web server to serve a basic website.
3. Security Hardening:
    * Update the server's operating system and packages.
    * Configure a firewall to restrict unnecessary traffic.
    * Implement SSH key-based authentication.
4. Verification:
    * Access your website from your local machine using its public IP address or DNS name.
    * Test the security of your server using online vulnerability scanners.

This mini-project will help you consolidate your learning and gain practical experience with AWS services. Remember to document your steps and any challenges you encounter.
