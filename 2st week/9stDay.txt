Day 9: Network Security and Firewalls

1. Firewalls

Purpose of Firewalls:
Prevent unauthorized access to or from a private network.
Monitor and filter traffic based on security rules.

Types of Firewalls:
Packet-Filtering Firewalls: Inspect packets and allow or block them based on rules (e.g., IP addresses, ports).
Stateful Inspection Firewalls: Track the state of active connections and make decisions based on context.

Proxy Firewalls: Act as intermediaries between end users and the internet, filtering traffic at the application layer.
Next-Generation Firewalls (NGFW): Combine traditional firewall features with advanced capabilities like intrusion prevention and deep packet inspection.

Linux Firewall Tools:
iptables: A traditional tool for configuring firewall rules in Linux.
nftables: A modern replacement for iptables, offering better performance and flexibility.

2. Network Security Concepts

Common Network Security Threats:
Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attacks: Overwhelm a system with traffic to make it unavailable.
Port Scanning: Attackers scan open ports to identify vulnerabilities.
Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks: Intercept and alter communication between two parties.
Malware: Malicious software designed to damage or gain unauthorized access.

Basic Security Measures:
Encryption: Protect data in transit using protocols like TLS/SSL.
Virtual Private Networks (VPNs): Create secure, encrypted connections over the internet.
Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS): Monitor networks for suspicious activity.
Regular Updates: Keep systems and software up to date to patch vulnerabilities.

3. Hands-on

Configure a firewall on your VM using `iptables` (or `nftables`).
Experiment with different firewall rules to allow/block specific traffic.
