Day 8: Linux Networking Deep Dive

1. TCP/IP Stack
The TCP/IP model is fundamental for understanding how network communication works. It consists of four layers:

Application Layer:
Handles network applications (HTTP, FTP, DNS, etc.).
Provides services directly to users.
Transport Layer:
Manages communication between devices (TCP and UDP).
TCP offers reliable connections, while UDP is faster but does not guarantee delivery.
Network Layer:
Responsible for packet routing (IP, ICMP).
Uses IP addresses to identify devices on the network.
Link Layer:
Manages data transmission over the physical medium (Ethernet, Wi-Fi).
Includes MAC addresses to identify devices on a local network.

IP Addresses: Identify devices on a network (IPv4 and IPv6).
Subnetting: Dividing a network into subnets for better management.
CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing): Notation to define IP address ranges (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24).
Routing Tables: Determine how packets are sent between networks.

2. Network Tools

tcpdump:
Captures and analyzes network traffic in real-time.
Basic example:sudo tcpdump -i eth0

Wireshark:
Graphical tool for advanced traffic analysis.
Allows detailed inspection of packets (headers, payloads).
Can be used alongside tcpdump to capture and then analyze

3. Hands-on:
Capture and analyze network traffic on your VM using `tcpdump` and `Wireshark`.
Experiment with different network configurations on your VM.
