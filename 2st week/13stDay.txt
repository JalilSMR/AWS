Subnets, Route Tables, and Internet Gateways

Subnets:
A subnet is a segment of a VPC's IP address range where you can place groups of isolated resources.
Subnets can be public or private

Route Tables:
A route table contains a set of rules, called routes, that determine where network traffic from your subnet or gateway is directed

Internet Gateway (IGW):
An Internet Gateway is a horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available VPC component that allows communication between instances in your VPC and the internet.

Network Access Control Lists (NACLs):
Network Access Control Lists are an optional layer of security for your VPC that act as a firewall for controlling traffic in and out of one or more subnets.

2. Hands-on
Create a VPC with a public subnet.
Launch an EC2 instance in the public subnet.
Configure routing to allow internet access from the instance.
