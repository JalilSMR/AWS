Day 14: Mini Project - Secure Web Server Deployment

Goal: Apply your knowledge to deploy a secure web server on AWS.

1. Environment Setup
Launched an EC2 Instance:
  Created a VPC and subnets.
  Launched an EC2 instance in the public subnet with a public IP.
Configured Security Groups:
  Allowed SSH (port 22), HTTP (port 80), and HTTPS (port 443) traffic.
  Restricted SSH access to specific IPs for enhanced security.

2. Web Server Installation
Installed a Web Server:
  Installed Apache or Nginx on the EC2 instance.
  Configured the web server to serve a basic "Hello, World!" HTML page.
Started and Enabled the Web Server:
  Ensured the web server starts automatically on boot.

3. Security Hardening
Updated the Server:
  Updated the operating system and installed packages to the latest versions.
Configured a Firewall:
  Used ufw (Ubuntu) or security groups to restrict unnecessary traffic.
Implemented SSH Key-Based Authentication:
  Disabled password authentication for SSH to enhance security.

4. Verification
Accessed the Website:
  Verified the website by accessing it via the instance's public IP or DNS name.
Tested Security:
  Used online vulnerability scanners to ensure only necessary ports were open.
  Confirmed SSH key-based authentication was working as expected.

This mini-project will help you consolidate your learning and gain practical experience with AWS services. Remember to document your steps and any challenges you encounter.
