Week 2 Project: Secure File Transfer Server

This project focuses on setting up a secure file transfer server on your Linux VM, allowing you to transfer files securely with other users or systems.

Steps:

Install an SSH server: If not already installed, install an SSH server on your Linux VM (e.g., sudo apt install openssh-server).
Configure SSH for key-based authentication: Disable password authentication and enable key-based authentication for enhanced security. This involves generating an SSH key pair on your local machine and adding the public key to the authorized_keys file on your VM.
Set up a user for file transfer: Create a dedicated user account on your VM specifically for file transfers. Assign appropriate permissions to a directory for this user to access and manage files.
Configure a firewall: Use iptables (or nftables) to configure your firewall to allow only SSH traffic from trusted IP addresses.
Test file transfer: From your local machine, use an SFTP client (like FileZilla) to connect to your VM using the dedicated user account and your private key. Test uploading and downloading files.
Proof of Completion:

Screenshots of your SSH server configuration (/etc/ssh/sshd_config) showing key-based authentication enabled.
Screenshots of your firewall rules (iptables -L) showing only SSH traffic allowed.
A screen recording of you successfully transferring files to and from your VM using an SFTP client.
