Day 10: Introduction to AWS EC2

EC2 Concepts:

Understand Amazon EC2 as a service for running virtual machines in the cloud.
    Amazon EC2 provides on-demand, scalable computing capacity in the AWS cloud, it reduces hardware costs to launch as many
    or as few virtual servers as we need, configure security and networking, and manage storage.
Learn about different EC2 instance types and their characteristics (CPU, memory, storage, network performance).
    Each instance of EC2 have a determined number of characters, the firts one is the instance familiy (here is the series, Generation and Options)
    and the instance size. For example c7gn.2xlarge, is a c series, generation 7, and it is a large instance. This have 8vCPU, 16GB of ram, an storage from EBS
    A network bandwith up to 50 and a EBS bandwith up to 10 Gbps
Explore Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) as pre-configured templates for EC2 instances.
    Is an image that provides the software that is requiered to set up and boot in Amazon EC2 instance. Each one contains a block device mappping that specifies
    the block devices to attach to the instance.
    An AMI is specific to the following
        Region
        Operating system
        Processor architectures
        Root device type
        Virtualization Type
Hands-on:

Launch an EC2 instance using the AWS Management Console.
Choose an Amazon Linux 2 AMI.
Select a t2.micro instance type (free tier eligible).
Connect to the instance using SSH.
Use the key pair you downloaded when launching the instance.
Explore the instance's operating system and configuration.
Run some basic Linux commands (e.g., uname -a, df -h).
Proof: Take screenshots of the EC2 instance launch wizard, the SSH connection, and the output of the commands you ran on the instance.
