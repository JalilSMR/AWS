Day 10: Introduction to AWS EC2

EC2 Concepts:

Understand Amazon EC2 as a service for running virtual machines in the cloud.
Learn about different EC2 instance types and their characteristics (CPU, memory, storage, network performance).
Explore Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) as pre-configured templates for EC2 instances.
Hands-on:

Launch an EC2 instance using the AWS Management Console.
Choose an Amazon Linux 2 AMI.
Select a t2.micro instance type (free tier eligible).
Connect to the instance using SSH.
Use the key pair you downloaded when launching the instance.
Explore the instance's operating system and configuration.
Run some basic Linux commands (e.g., uname -a, df -h).
Proof: Take screenshots of the EC2 instance launch wizard, the SSH connection, and the output of the commands you ran on the instance.
