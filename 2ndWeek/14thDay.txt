Day 14: Mini Project - Secure Web Server Deployment with Monitoring and Logging

Goal: Apply your knowledge to deploy a secure web server on AWS with monitoring and logging capabilities.

Environment Setup:

Launch an EC2 instance in your VPC (use the one from Day 13).
Configure security groups to allow SSH access from your IP and HTTP/HTTPS access from anywhere.
Web Server Installation:

Install a web server (Apache or Nginx) on the instance.
Configure the web server to serve a basic website.
Create an index.html file.
Security Hardening:

Update the server's operating system and packages.
Configure a firewall using iptables (or nftables) to restrict unnecessary traffic.
Implement SSH key-based authentication.
Monitoring and Logging:

Install and configure the AWS CloudWatch agent on the instance.
Collect system metrics (CPU utilization, memory usage, disk space) and web server logs.
Create a CloudWatch dashboard to visualize the collected data.
Set up CloudWatch alarms to notify you of any unusual activity or errors.
Verification:

Access your website from your local machine using its public IP address or DNS name.
Test the security of your server using online vulnerability scanners.
Monitor the CloudWatch dashboard and alarms for any issues.
Proof:

Screenshots of the EC2 instance, security group configuration, and web server setup.
Screenshots of the CloudWatch agent installation, configuration, and dashboard.
Screenshots of the CloudWatch alarms.
A screen recording of you accessing your website and demonstrating the monitoring and logging capabilities.
This mini-project will challenge you to integrate your Linux and AWS skills, including networking, security, and monitoring. It's a great way to consolidate your learning and gain practical experience with real-world scenarios. Remember to document your steps and take screenshots as you progress. Good luck!
