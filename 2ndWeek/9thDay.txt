Day 9: Network Security and Firewalls

Firewalls:

Understand the purpose of firewalls in protecting networks from unauthorized access.
Learn about iptables (or nftables, if your distribution uses it) for managing firewalls on Linux.
List existing firewall rules: sudo iptables -L
Allow incoming SSH traffic: sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT
Block all other incoming traffic: sudo iptables -P INPUT DROP
Explore different firewall rules and how to configure them to allow or block specific traffic.
Network Security Concepts:

Learn about common network security threats:
Denial-of-service (DoS) attacks
Port scanning
Man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks
Understand basic security measures:
Encryption (e.g., HTTPS, SSH)
Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)
Hands-on:

Configure a basic firewall on your VM using iptables (or nftables).
Allow only SSH access from your host machine's IP address.
Test the firewall by trying to access different ports on your VM from your host machine.
Proof: Take screenshots of your iptables rules and the results of your tests.
