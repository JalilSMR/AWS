Day 13: Amazon VPC Fundamentals

VPC Concepts:

Understand Amazon VPC as a service for creating logically isolated networks in the AWS cloud.
Learn about subnets, route tables, and internet gateways.
Subnets: Segments of a VPC with their own IP address range.
Route tables: Define how network traffic is routed within a VPC.
Internet gateways: Allow communication between a VPC and the internet.
Explore network access control lists (NACLs) as an optional layer of security for subnets.
Hands-on:

Create a VPC with a public subnet.
Choose an IP address range for your VPC.
Launch an EC2 instance in the public subnet.
Configure routing to allow internet access from the instance.
Create a route table and associate it with the subnet.
Add a route to the internet gateway.
Proof: Take screenshots of your VPC configuration, the subnet, the route table, and the EC2 instance in the public subnet.
