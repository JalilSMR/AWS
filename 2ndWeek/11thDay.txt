Day 11: EC2 Security and Networking

Security Groups:

Understand how security groups act as virtual firewalls for EC2 instances.
Learn to configure security group rules to control inbound and outbound traffic.
Allow HTTP access on port 80.
Allow HTTPS access on port 443.
Elastic IP Addresses:

Explore the concept of Elastic IP addresses as static public IP addresses for EC2 instances.
    A Elastic IP Addresses is a static Public IPv4 that you can associate with the AWS resources, they´re elastic because it can be easily remap them
    to different instances or network interfaces with your AWS accounts as your needs change
Understand their use cases (e.g., for web servers, for instances with dynamic public IPs).
    Web servers: If you´re hosting a website on EC2 you´ll ned a consistent IP addres that users can access.
    Failover: In a HA setup, if the primary istance fails, it can quickly reasociate the Elastic IP with a standby instance
    Remote access: If you need to consistently connect to the instances outside AWS, for axample SSH access
    DNS Records: When configuring DNS recors, we need a static IP address to point to.
    Network Address Translation (NAT): Elastic IPs can be used as NAT gateways to allow instances in a private subnet to acces the internet
Hands-on:

Create a security group that allows SSH access only from your IP address and HTTP/HTTPS access from anywhere.
Apply this security group to your EC2 instance.
Allocate an Elastic IP address and associate it with your instance.
Proof: Take screenshots of the security group configuration, the Elastic IP allocation, and the association with your instance.
