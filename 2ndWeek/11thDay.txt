Day 11: EC2 Security and Networking

Security Groups:

Understand how security groups act as virtual firewalls for EC2 instances.
Learn to configure security group rules to control inbound and outbound traffic.
Allow HTTP access on port 80.
Allow HTTPS access on port 443.
Elastic IP Addresses:

Explore the concept of Elastic IP addresses as static public IP addresses for EC2 instances.
Understand their use cases (e.g., for web servers, for instances with dynamic public IPs).
Hands-on:

Create a security group that allows SSH access only from your IP address and HTTP/HTTPS access from anywhere.
Apply this security group to your EC2 instance.
Allocate an Elastic IP address and associate it with your instance.
Proof: Take screenshots of the security group configuration, the Elastic IP allocation, and the association with your instance.
