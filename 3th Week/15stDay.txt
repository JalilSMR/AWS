Day 15: Advanced EC2 Configurations

1. Instance Metadata and User Data

Instance Metadata: Metadata provides information about your EC2 instance, such as instance ID, public IP, AMI ID, and more.
Use the following command from within the instance: curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/

User Data: Scripts or configuration data passed to an instance at launch to automate setup tasks.
User data can be used to install software, update configurations, or run scripts.

Example: Add a user data script when launching an EC2 instance to install Apache web server:
#!/bin/bash
yum update -y
yum install -y httpd
systemctl start httpd
systemctl enable httpd

2. EC2 Placement Groups

Cluster Placement Group:
Instances are grouped within a single Availability Zone (AZ) for low-latency, high-throughput performance.
Use case: High-performance computing (HPC), tightly coupled workloads.

Spread Placement Group:
Instances are spread across distinct hardware to reduce the risk of simultaneous failures.
Use case: Critical applications requiring high availability.

Partition Placement Group:
Instances are divided into partitions, each running on separate hardware.
Use case: Large distributed workloads like Hadoop or Kafka.

Understand the use cases for each placement group type
Cluster: Best for workloads requiring low latency and high network throughput.
Spread: Best for fault tolerance and minimizing simultaneous failures.
Partition: Best for large-scale, distributed applications.

3. Hands-on
Use user data to install software and configure settings on an EC2 instance during launch.
Experiment with different placement groups and observe their impact on network performance.
