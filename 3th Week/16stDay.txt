Day 16:  Elastic Block Store (EBS)

1. EBS Volumes

Understand Different EBS Volume Types

General Purpose SSD (gp2 and gp3):
gp2: Baseline performance of 3 IOPS/GB, up to 16,000 IOPS.
gp3: Allows independent scaling of IOPS and throughput, cost-effective for most workloads.

Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1 and io2):
io1: High performance with up to 64,000 IOPS and 1,000 MB/s throughput.
io2: Higher durability and performance, up to 256,000 IOPS and 4,000 MB/s throughput.

Throughput Optimized HDD (st1): Designed for frequently accessed, throughput-intensive workloads (e.g., big data, data warehouses).
Cold HDD (sc1): Low-cost storage for infrequently accessed data (e.g., backups, archives).

Learn About EBS Volume Performance Characteristics

IOPS (Input/Output Operations Per Second): Measures read/write operations.
Throughput: Measures data transfer speed (MB/s).
Latency: Time taken for a read/write operation.
Burst Performance: Temporary performance boost for gp2 volumes.

Explore EBS Snapshots for Backups and Data Transfer

Snapshots: Point-in-time backups of EBS volumes stored in S3.
Incremental backups (only changes are saved).
Can be used to create new volumes or migrate data across regions.
Data Transfer: Snapshots can be shared across AWS accounts or copied to other regions.

2. Hands-on:
Create and attach EBS volumes to an EC2 instance.
Take EBS snapshots and restore volumes from snapshots.
Experiment with different EBS volume types and observe their performance.
