Day 20: Introduction to the AWS Well-Architected Framework

1. Six Pillars

Operational Excellence
Focuses on running and monitoring systems to deliver business value and continuously improving processes and procedures.
Key topics: Automation, incident management, and operational readiness.

Security
Ensures the protection of information and systems through security best practices.
Key topics: Identity and access management, threat detection, data protection, and incident response.

Reliability
Ensures workloads perform their intended functions correctly and consistently, even when failures occur.
Key topics: Fault tolerance, recovery planning, and scalability.

Performance Efficiency
Focuses on using computing resources efficiently to meet system requirements and maintain efficiency as demand changes.
Key topics: Right-sizing, monitoring, and selecting the appropriate resource types.

Cost Optimization
Aims to avoid unnecessary costs and maximize the value of your cloud investment.
Key topics: Cost-effective resources, demand management, and optimizing over time.

Sustainability Pillar
The Sustainability Pillar emphasizes designing and operating workloads to reduce energy consumption and improve resource utilization, aligning with environmental best practices

2. Design Principles

Operational Excellence
Perform operations as code.
Make frequent, small, reversible changes.
Refine operations procedures frequently.
Anticipate failure.
Learn from all operational failures.

Security
Implement a strong identity foundation.
Enable traceability.
Apply security at all layers.
Automate security best practices.
Protect data in transit and at rest.
Prepare for security events.

Reliability
Test recovery procedures.
Automatically recover from failure.
Scale horizontally to increase workload availability.
Stop guessing capacity.
Manage change in automation.

Performance Efficiency
Democratize advanced technologies.
Go global in minutes.
Use serverless architectures.
Experiment more often.
Consider mechanical sympathy (align technology with workload needs).

Cost Optimization
Adopt a consumption model.
Measure overall efficiency.
Stop spending money on undifferentiated heavy lifting.
Analyze and attribute expenditure.
Use managed services to reduce cost of ownership.

Sustainability
Understand Your Workload's Environmental Impact
Maximize Resource Efficiency
Use Managed Services
Design for Energy Proportionality
Reduce the Impact of Data

3. Hands-on:
Review the Well-Architected Framework whitepaper.
Start thinking about how the framework applies to your mini-project from Week 2.
