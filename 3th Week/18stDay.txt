Day 18:  S3 Data Management Features

1. Lifecycle Policies

Amazon S3 Lifecycle Policies allow you to automate the management of objects stored in your S3 buckets. 
These policies help you transition objects to different storage classes or delete them after a specified period, optimizing costs and ensuring compliance.

Key Concepts
Storage Classes: S3 offers multiple storage classes, including:
S3 Standard: General-purpose storage for frequently accessed data.
S3 Intelligent-Tiering: Automatically moves data between access tiers based on usage patterns.
S3 Standard-IA (Infrequent Access): For data accessed less frequently but requiring rapid access.
S3 One Zone-IA: Lower-cost option for infrequently accessed data stored in a single availability zone.
S3 Glacier: Low-cost storage for archival data with retrieval times ranging from minutes to hours.
S3 Glacier Deep Archive: Lowest-cost storage for long-term archival with retrieval times of 12 hours or more.

Lifecycle Rules
Transition Actions: Move objects to a different storage class after a specified period (e.g., move to Glacier after 30 days).
Expiration Actions: Delete objects after a specified period (e.g., delete after 365 days).
Abort Incomplete Multipart Uploads: Clean up incomplete multipart uploads after a specified period.

2. S3 Transfer Acceleration

S3 Transfer Acceleration uses Amazon CloudFront’s globally distributed edge locations to accelerate uploads to S3. It is particularly useful for transferring large files over long distances.

How It Works:
Instead of uploading directly to an S3 bucket, the data is routed through the nearest CloudFront edge location.
The edge location optimizes the transfer and forwards the data to the S3 bucket.

Benefits:
Faster upload speeds, especially for clients located far from the S3 bucket’s region.
Improved performance for large file uploads.

3. Cross-Region Replication

Cross-Region Replication automatically replicates objects from a source bucket in one region to a destination bucket in another region. This is useful for disaster recovery, compliance, and low-latency access.

Key Concepts:
Versioning: Both the source and destination buckets must have versioning enabled.
Replication Rules: Define which objects to replicate (e.g., all objects or objects with a specific prefix).
IAM Role: An IAM role with the necessary permissions must be created to allow S3 to replicate objects.

4. Hands-on

Create a lifecycle policy to transition objects to Glacier after a certain period.
Enable S3 Transfer Acceleration for your bucket.
Configure cross-region replication for your bucket.
