Day 17:  S3 Security and Access Control

1. Access Control Lists (ACLs)

What are ACLs?
ACLs are a legacy access control mechanism that allows you to grant read and write permissions to specific AWS accounts or predefined groups (e.g., "Everyone" or "Authenticated Users").
ACLs are applied at both the bucket level and the object level.

How ACLs Work:
Each bucket and object has an ACL attached to it.
You can grant permissions like READ, WRITE, and FULL_CONTROL to AWS accounts or groups.
  
2. Bucket Policies

What are Bucket Policies?
Bucket policies are JSON-based documents that define permissions for the entire bucket.
They allow you to control access at the bucket level, including allowing or denying access based on conditions like IP address, AWS account, or request time.

Key Features
Fine-grained control: You can specify permissions for specific users, roles, or AWS accounts.
Public access control: You can block public access to the bucket or allow specific public actions.
Conditions: You can use conditions like aws:SourceIp to restrict access based on IP ranges.

3. S3 Security Best Practices

Encryption:

SSE-S3: Server-Side Encryption with Amazon S3-Managed Keys.
SSE-KMS: Server-Side Encryption with AWS Key Management Service (KMS) keys.
SSE-C: Server-Side Encryption with Customer-Provided Keys.
Always enable encryption for sensitive data at rest.

Versioning:
Enable versioning to protect against accidental deletion or overwriting of objects.
Versioning allows you to restore previous versions of an object.

Logging:
Enable S3 Access Logs to track requests made to your bucket.
Logs can be stored in another S3 bucket for analysis.

Block Public Access:
Use the Block Public Access settings to prevent accidental public exposure of your bucket or objects.

IAM Policies:
Use IAM policies to grant least privilege access to users and roles.

MFA Delete:
Enable MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) Delete to add an extra layer of security for deleting objects.

4. Hands-on:
Configure ACLs and bucket policies to control access to your S3 bucket.
Enable versioning and logging on your S3 bucket.
Experiment with S3 encryption options (SSE-S3, SSE-KMS, SSE-C).
